# Roadmap

## Overview

This is a resource management game similar to factorio or idle games.

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Planning**

- Study the existing codebase and understand the current state
- Create a new task file in the `/tasks` directory
- Name format: `XXX-description.md` (e.g., `001-db.md`)
- Include high-level specifications, relevant files, acceptance criteria, and implementation steps
- Refer to last completed task in the `/tasks` directory for examples. For example, if the current task is `012`, refer to `011` and `010` for examples.

2. **Task Implementation**

- Follow the specifications in the task file
- Implement features and functionality
- Update step progress within the task file after each step
- Stop after completing each step and wait for further instructions
